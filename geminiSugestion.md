As we start, here are a few suggestions to consider:

*   **Modular Architecture:** To keep the codebase clean and maintainable as it grows, we can organize the application into Laravel Modules. Each major feature (e.g., Asset Management, Maintenance, Audits) can be a separate module.
*   **Leverage Existing Features:** The boilerplate project already has user authentication, roles, and permissions. We should build on top of these for authorization.
