# 3) State machines (key workflows)

**Asset.status**

* available → checked_out → available
* available → leased → available
* available → reserved → available
* any → under_repair → available
* any → disposed/donated/sold/lost/broken (terminal; only admins can revert)

**Checkout.status**: open → overdue (by scheduler) → closed (on check-in)

**Lease.status**: active → overdue (by scheduler) → returned | cancelled

**Maintenance.status**: open → scheduled → in_progress → completed | cancelled → (auto overdue if `scheduled_for < now && !completed`)

**Audit.status**: draft → in_progress → review → closed

**Warranty.active**: derived from start/end dates; mark inactive on expiry.

---

# 4) Permissions (roles & key abilities)

* **Admin**: full access
* **Manager**: manage assets & operations, approvals, reports
* **Technician**: create maintenance, run audits, update status
* **Staff**: view assets, request reservations/checkout, upload docs
* **Auditor**: read-only + run audit flows, export reports
* **Read-only**: view & export where allowed

Map to policies:

* AssetPolicy: viewAny, view, create, update, delete, operate(checkout/lease/move/reserve/dispose), export, import
* MaintenancePolicy, AuditPolicy, WarrantyPolicy, StaffPolicy, Site/Location/Category/Department policies, ReportPolicy.

---

# 5) Backend architecture (Laravel 12)

**Core packages**

* spatie/laravel-permission (RBAC)
* spatie/laravel-activitylog (history/events)
* league/flysystem + S3/Local for files; (optional) spatie/laravel-medialibrary
* maatwebsite/excel for import/export
* laravel/scout (optional) for global search
* laravel/horizon (queues), laravel/sanctum (API auth)

**Key services**

* `AlertService`: builds due/expiring sets and writes `alerts`
* `AssetService`: create/update asset + custom fields + media
* `CheckoutService`, `LeaseService`, `ReservationService`, `MoveService`

* `DashboardService`: KPIs + charts aggregations
* Notifications: `AlertEmail`, `ReportEmail`, `MaintenanceReminder`

**Scheduler (app/Console/Kernel)**

* hourly: mark overdues (checkouts, leases, maintenance)
* daily: generate alerts for next 7/30 days (configurable)
* as scheduled: send saved reports
* nightly: rebuild materialized pivot/stats tables if you add them

**APIs** (for future app/PWA)

* `/api/assets` CRUD + search + operations endpoints
* `/api/maintenances`, `/api/audits`, `/api/reports/run`, `/api/imports`

**Validation & auditing**

* FormRequests + business rules (e.g., cannot check-out disposed asset)
* ActivityLog on every mutation (subject, event, user, properties)

---

# 6) Frontend (Inertia + Vue 3) structure

**Layout**

**Pages (routes)**

* `/dashboard` — KPI, pie by category, calendar widget (chips)
* `/alerts` — grouped; link to record
* `/assets`

  * `/assets` (Index)
  * `/assets/create`, `/assets/:id/edit`
  * `/assets/:id` (tabs: Details | Events | Photos | Docs | Warranty | Maintenance | Reserve | Audit | History)

# 7) Import/Export spec

**Import Wizard**

* Targets: Assets, Staff, Sites, Locations, Categories, Departments, Maintenance, Warranties
* Steps: (1) Upload CSV/XLSX → (2) Map columns to fields (auto-match on header) → (3) Validate preview (N errors shown with row numbers) → (4) Queue job → (5) Email summary
* Safety: dry-run mode, “update or create” toggle via Asset Tag ID
* Limits: chunk processing (e.g., 1,000 rows per chunk), 5,000/file UI hint
* Templates: downloadable per target; field limits (lengths/enums)

**Export**

* From any list/search; same column set as current view (column picker respected); CSV or XLSX; optional saved templates.

---

# 8) Reporting & dashboard

**Report families**

* Assets (inventory, by site/location/category/department, by status)
* Check-Out (open/overdue/closed; by assignee; aging)
* Leased Assets (active/overdue/returns)
* Maintenance (due/overdue/completed; costs; MTTR)
* Reservation (upcoming; utilization)
* Audit (variance; found vs expected)
* Warranty (by expiry window)
* Transactions/Status changes (activity log)
* **Custom**: generic filter builder + column selection

**Dashboard widgets (sample)**

* Number of Assets, Value of Assets, Purchases FY
* Available / Checked-out / Leased / Lost-Missing / Broken / Under Repair
* Disposed / Donated / Sold
* Warranty vs Assets (ratio)
* Widgets persist per user in a `user_dashboard_settings` JSON or table.

---

# 9) Field-level details (from the forms you sent)

**Assets**

* Required: description, asset_tag, purchase_date, cost, project_code, asset_condition
* Optional: purchased_from, brand, model, serial_no, site, location, category, department, photo
* Derived: status defaults to `available`
* Custom fields: “Project code” displayed under “Custom fields” group on view page

**Warranty**

* fields: active (bool), asset_tag_id (FK), description, length_months, expires_at, notes

**Maintenance List columns**

* status, expires (due date), asset_tag_id, description, title, maintenance_detail

**Staff**

* searchable on: name, employee ID, job title, email, phone; columns include site, location, department, notes

**Sites & Locations**

* Sites: address capture; Locations are **subset of Sites** (location belongs to site)

---

# 10) Day-by-day build roadmap (backend + frontend)

> 15 work-days (~3 weeks). Adjust pace as needed.

**Day 1 — Project & auth**

* ActivityLog for create/update

**Day 5 — Import/Export v1**

* Import: Assets (column map + dry-run + queue)
* Export: Assets (respect column picker)

**Day 6 — Movements**

* Move entity + history; “Move” operation wizard; activity entries

**Day 7 — Checkout/Check-in**

* Checkout table + constraints; due logic; check-in; overdue scheduler
* Alerts for asset due (open checkouts nearing due)

**Day 8 — Lease**

* Lease table + flows; return processing; overdue scheduler + alerts

---

# 11) Data validation & UX rules (high-impact)

* `asset_tag` unique; cannot change if there are linked operations unless admin
* Prevent checkout/lease/reserve if status in {disposed, donated, sold, lost, broken}
* Move requires `from_location_id != to_location_id`
* Maintenance cannot close without `completed_at` and optional costs
* Warranty `end_at = start_at + length_months` (if length given)
* Import: detect duplicates by asset_tag; report row/column errors
* Lists: persistent column setup per user; fast multi-facet filters

---

# 12) Nice-to-have (phase 2)

* Barcode/QR generation & print sheets; camera scan (PWA page)
* Meilisearch/Elasticsearch global search
* Bulk actions: mass move, mass assign department, mass status change
* Webhooks for integrations; SSO (OIDC/SAML)

---

# 13) What I can deliver next (just say the word)

* **SQL migrations starter pack** (tables above)
* **Policy stubs + seeder** for roles
* **Route map & Vue page skeletons** (folders, stubs, sample DataTable)
* A **printable System Spec + ERD PDF** (one document you can hand to your team)

If you want me to start with code stubs or the printable spec first, tell me which one you prefer.
